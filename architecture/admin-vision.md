# Admin Vision & Boundaries
## Maatify Admin Infra

> **Authoritative Vision Document — Phase 0 (LOCKED)**

---

## 🎯 Vision

**Maatify Admin Infra** is a reusable **Admin Infrastructure Library** designed to be embedded into any system to provide a secure, auditable, and extensible foundation for administrative access.

This library represents the **backend infrastructure layer** behind any Admin Panel — not a UI, not a CMS, and not a framework.

It exists to solve administrative identity, authentication, authorization, security controls, auditing, and system-level preferences **once and correctly**, then reuse them everywhere.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Across most systems:

- Admin authentication is reimplemented repeatedly
- Security decisions vary between projects
- Audit trails are incomplete or missing
- Emergency access is an afterthought
- External auth providers are trusted blindly
- Admin deletion breaks accountability

These patterns lead to fragile systems and long-term security risks.

**Maatify Admin Infra** enforces a consistent, hardened administrative foundation that eliminates these issues.

---

## 👥 Target Audience

This library is intended for:

- Backend developers
- SaaS / ERP / internal system builders
- Teams or individuals building multiple systems
- Projects requiring long-term security and traceability

It is **not** intended for:
- End users
- Consumer authentication
- UI-only dashboards

---

## 🧱 Scope (What This Library Does)

The library is responsible for:

### 1. Admin Identity
- Persistent admin identity
- Explicit lifecycle states
- No deletion policy

### 2. Authentication
- Email + password login
- Deterministic failure behavior
- Session control
- Optional multi-factor authentication (TOTP)

### 3. Authorization
- Roles
- Permissions
- Ability-based access control

### 4. Security Controls
- Account locking
- Device and session management
- Emergency access patterns
- Impersonation (controlled and audited)

### 5. Audit & Activity
- Admin actions
- Security events
- Optional view tracking
- Pluggable storage (e.g. MongoDB)

### 6. Notifications (Infrastructure)
- Security alerts
- System notifications
- Multiple channels (Telegram, Email)
- Opt-in / opt-out control

### 7. System Preferences
- Language
- Timezone
- Locale
- Admin-specific settings

### 8. System Settings
- Feature flags
- Global security toggles
- Maintenance controls

## 🚫 Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

This library **will not**:

- ❌ Provide any UI or frontend components
- ❌ Act as a CMS
- ❌ Replace application business logic
- ❌ Act as Auth-as-a-Service
- ❌ Depend on any PHP framework
- ❌ Read environment variables directly
- ❌ Automatically create admin accounts
- ❌ Allow admin account deletion
- ❌ Trust external identity providers blindly
- ❌ Perform analytics or reporting
- ❌ Define frontend behavior or styling

Any feature outside these boundaries is considered **out of scope**.

## 🔒 Core Security Principles (LOCKED)

- Secure by default
- Explicit configuration over magic
- Least privilege at all levels
- No silent fallbacks
- Deterministic authentication failures
- Full auditability
- No irreversible destructive actions

---

## 🧩 Architectural Principles

- Infrastructure-first design
- Database-agnostic core
- Driver-based integrations
- Clear separation of concerns
- Composed identity (not monolithic tables)
- Asynchronous side effects where possible
- External services are never trusted implicitly

---

## 🚨 Identity & Deletion Policy

Admin identities are **never deleted**.

Rationale:
- Legal accountability
- Audit integrity
- Security traceability

Admins may only transition between explicit states:
- created
- pending_verification
- active
- suspended
- locked

---

## 🌐 External Services Policy

External services (Google, Telegram, etc.):

- Are treated as **integrations**, not authorities
- Never bypass internal security
- Never replace internal MFA
- Never define permissions

Telegram is strictly limited to:
- Notifications
- Security alerts

Telegram is **not**:
- A login method
- A second-factor authenticator
- An identity provider

---

## 🏁 Definition of Phase 0 Completion

Phase 0 is considered **complete and locked** when:

- Vision is documented
- Scope boundaries are explicit
- Non-goals are enforced
- Core principles are agreed upon
- Future phases must conform to this document

---

## 📌 Enforcement Rule

> Any feature or decision that contradicts this document **must be rejected**,
> regardless of convenience or implementation simplicity.
