# Admin Operations, Exports & Observability Architecture
## Maatify Admin Infra

> **Authoritative Architecture Document — Phase 8 (LOCKED)**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines the **operations, data export, and observability architecture**
for **Maatify Admin Infra**.

It establishes:
- How operational actions are executed safely
- How data is exported without impacting the system
- How the system is observed (logs, metrics, health)
- Clear separation between **operations**, **audit**, and **analytics**

This document is **authoritative** and binding for all implementations.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles (LOCKED)

- Operations are **explicit and permissioned**
- Exports are **asynchronous and isolated**
- Observability is **read-only**
- No operation blocks core request paths
- No export runs inline
- No operational action bypasses audit
- No analytics logic inside core

---

## 🧱 Architectural Position

Operations and observability are **outer layers** around the core.

```

Admin Infra Core
|
+--> Operations Service
|
+--> Export Service
|
+--> Observability Layer

```

Each layer is independent and replaceable.

---

## 🧩 Operations Architecture

### Scope of Operations

Operations include:
- Bulk actions (e.g., revoke sessions)
- Maintenance tasks
- Security responses
- Data lifecycle controls
- Background system actions

---

### Operations Rules (LOCKED)

- Every operation:
  - Requires explicit permission
  - Is audited
  - Has a clear scope and target
- No destructive operation is silent
- No operation is irreversible without traceability

---

### Conceptual Model: `admin_operations`

```

## admin_operations

* id (PK)
* type
* actor_admin_id
* target_type
* target_id (nullable)
* parameters (json)
* status (pending | running | completed | failed)
* started_at
* finished_at

```

---

## 🧩 Export Architecture

### Export Scope

Exports may include:
- Admin lists
- Audit logs
- Security events
- System configurations
- Activity summaries

Exports **must not** include:
- Passwords
- Secrets
- Tokens
- Encrypted fields

---

### Export Execution Rules (LOCKED)

- Exports are:
  - Always asynchronous
  - Executed via background workers
  - Isolated from request lifecycle
- Large exports:
  - Streamed
  - Chunked
  - Rate-limited
- Export generation never locks core tables

---

### Conceptual Model: `admin_exports`

```

## admin_exports

* id (PK)
* requested_by (admin_id)
* export_type
* parameters (json)
* file_format (csv | json | pdf)
* status (queued | processing | ready | expired | failed)
* file_location
* expires_at
* created_at

```

---

### Export Delivery

- Download via secure, time-limited URLs
- Optional notification on completion
- No public exposure
- One-time or expiring access

---

## 🧩 Observability Architecture

Observability is composed of **three pillars**:

1. Logs
2. Metrics
3. Health & Status

---

## 📜 Logs

### Scope
- Application logs
- Infrastructure logs
- Integration failures

**Rules (LOCKED):**
- Logs are not audit
- Logs are not analytics
- Logs may be rotated and truncated

---

## 📊 Metrics

### Scope
- Request counts
- Error rates
- Authentication failures
- Export queue depth
- Notification delivery failures

**Rules (LOCKED):**
- Aggregated only
- No PII
- No identifiers
- Used for monitoring, not decisions

---

## ❤️ Health & Status

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- Cache availability
- Audit backend availability
- Notification channels availability

### Status Endpoints
- Read-only
- No sensitive data
- Permission-protected if exposed internally

---

## 🔐 Access Control

### Required Permissions (Examples)

- `operations.execute`
- `exports.request`
- `exports.download`
- `observability.view`
- `system.health.view`

All permissions are enforced via Phase 3 (Authorization).

---

## 🧾 Audit Requirements (Mandatory)

The following **must be audited** (Phase 4):

- Operation execution
- Operation failure
- Export request
- Export completion
- Export download
- Observability access (if privileged)

---

## 🔒 Security Constraints (LOCKED)

- ❌ No exports inline
- ❌ No blocking operations
- ❌ No export without audit
- ❌ No direct file access
- ❌ No observability data used for auth decisions
- ❌ No secrets in logs or metrics

---

## 🚫 Forbidden Patterns (LOCKED)

- ❌ Running operations in controllers
- ❌ Exporting raw database dumps
- ❌ Long-running tasks in web requests
- ❌ Exposing metrics publicly
- ❌ Mixing analytics with audit
- ❌ Using observability to infer permissions

---

## 🏁 Status

> ✅ **FINAL · LOCKED · AUTHORITATIVE**

This document governs **all operational behavior, exports, and observability**
for **Maatify Admin Infra**.
